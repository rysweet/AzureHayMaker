# Azure HayMaker - Vision & Mission

**Long-term vision for the project**

---

## 🎯 Mission Statement

Enable realistic Azure tenant simulation through intelligent, autonomous agents that generate benign operational telemetry across diverse technology scenarios.

---

## 🌟 Vision (3-5 Years)

**Become the industry standard for**:
- Azure environment simulation and testing
- Tenant activity generation
- Cloud service validation
- Training and demonstration environments

## 💡 Core Principles

### 1. Automation First
Everything should be automated:
- Deployment
- Execution
- Monitoring
- Cleanup
- Recovery

### 2. Security by Default
- No secrets in code or config
- Key Vault for all credentials
- RBAC-based access
- Audit logging always on
- Principle of least privilege

### 3. Cost Consciousness
- Efficient resource usage
- Automatic cleanup
- Cost monitoring built-in
- Optimization recommendations
- Pay-per-use where possible

### 4. Observability
- Complete visibility into operations
- Real-time monitoring
- Comprehensive logging
- Metrics and dashboards
- Alert-driven operations

### 5. Scalability
- Support 1 to 1000+ scenarios
- Multi-region capable
- Auto-scaling infrastructure
- Performance optimized
